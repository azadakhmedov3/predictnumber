# predict_number-
This project predicts number <br />
1.png --> Script predicts it as 1, because of the straight line in picture <br />
2.png --> Script predicts it as 2, because it looks like the handwriting of 2 and down side may help it in prediction <br />
3.png --> Script predicts it as 3, because it looks like the handwriting of 3, and also curves may be help it in prediction <br />
4.png --> Script predicts it as 4, beacuse it looks like print 4, and also <br />
5.png --> Script predicts it as 5, because it look like handwriting 5, and curve on the right side help it in prediction <br />
6.png --> Script predicts it as 5, because if we look close down left side, it looks like 5 <br />
7.png --> Script predicts it as 7, because it looks like print 7, and angle between straight lines may help it to predict 7 <br />
8.png --> Script predicts it as 8, because it looks like handwriting 8, and 2 circles in the picture may help it to predict 8 <br />
9.png --> Script predicts it as 9, because it looks like handwriting 9, and down side may help it to predict 9 <br />
0.png --> Script predicts it as 0, because it looks like circle as 0 <br />
